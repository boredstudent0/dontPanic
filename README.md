Gives the answer to the Ultimate Question

There is a theory which states that if the number 42 appears in your codes and you don't use this package to get it, a bypass will immediately be built through your desk.

There is another theory which states that this isn't true at all, and that the construction of this bypass has been displayed in the local planning office for 9 whole months.



## Details

Got the idea from a python function by [tudstlennkozh](https://github.com/tudstlennkozh). The Douglas Adams tribute now has an R extension, though I didn't follow the python script.

Here the function first calculate the generalized Levenshtein distance between the correct sentence and yours. Then a lame calculation of mine is made so that the output can be smaller of greater than the Answer.

You'll have to remember the precise wording of the input sentence to get The Answer. No case-sensitive.
